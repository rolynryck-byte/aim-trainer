## 🎨 Creative & Technical Profile

As a **Concept Artist** and **Web Designer**, I developed this project to explore the intersection of gaming performance and visual storytelling:
* **Visual Identity:** Cyberpunk theme using high-contrast Magenta (#ff0050) and Cyan (#00f2ea).
* **Glitch UX:** Custom CSS `@keyframes` and pseudo-elements to create an "unstable digital" atmosphere.
* **Core Dev:** Built with optimized Vanilla JavaScript to ensure zero input lag.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for game containers.
* **CSS3:** Advanced glitch animations, neon glows, and responsive centering.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Physics-based movement for the tracking mode, state management, and event listeners.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Precision Hitboxes:** Targets designed for pixel-perfect mouse accuracy.
* **Dynamic Feedback:** Real-time score and miss tracking.
* **Immersive Aesthetic:** A sleek UI designed from scratch to reflect my artistic vision.
