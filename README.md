## 🕹️ Game Modes

### 1. Flick Mode (Precision)
Test your snap-to-target speed. Targets appear at random locations and disappear after a short duration.
* **Difficulties:** Easy, Medium, and Hardcore (each with unique visual vibration intensities).
* **Game Over:** Reaching 10 misses ends the session.

### 2. Tracking Mode (Consistency)
Train your ability to follow a moving target. The target moves continuously across the screen.
* **Mechanics:** Earn points by keeping your cursor over the moving target.
* **Challenge:** High tolerance mode (1,000 misses) for long-duration training.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Advanced animations using `@keyframes`, pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`), and **Flexbox** for responsive centering.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** DOM manipulation, interval management (`setInterval`), and game state logic.



## ✨ Key Features

* **Dynamic Vibrations:** Each difficulty level has a specific "vibration" signature that activates only on hover.
* **Fully Responsive:** Centering logic uses `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`, ensuring the UI looks perfect on any screen size.
* **Glitch UI:** A sleek Cyberpunk aesthetic with Cyan and Magenta layers.
